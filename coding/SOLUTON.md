## Solution

As a DevOps engineer it is my responsiblity to support the Software Engineering staff
and not to write applications for them.

My solution is to take example code and modify it as I would if I was helping
the engineering team solve this problems, as it is rare that a DevOps engineer should
have to originate the solution to purely business application requirement.
