# Solution
As a DevOps engineer it is my primary responsiblity to support the Software Engineering staff
and to let them do what they are good at, writing software.

As I am horrible at writing regex, I have simply found two examples, both in python and go
and modified them as I would if I was helping the engineering team solve this problem.

I have created a makefile to build the go program and read input from a directory and file
input/sample_imput.txt

The python version is not yet complete but should be by end of day and will also be able
to parse the input filename.
